# libft
## Description

**Libft** is the first project of the 42 cursus and consists of creating a personal library in the C programming language.  
The main goal is to understand the internal behavior of standard C functions, learn how to manage memory manually, and build a solid foundation that will be useful in future projects.

This library reimplements functions from the libc, adds additional utilities, and provides tools to handle singly linked lists, strictly following the specifications described in the `man` pages and the 42 Norminette.
